### **Title :**

Transferring Files Across AWS S3 Buckets in Different AWS Accounts Using
Scripting

### **Introduction:**

This assignment focuses on demonstrating your understanding and practical
implementation of transferring files from one Amazon S3 bucket to another, but with a
twist - the buckets reside in different AWS accounts. The objective is to achieve this file
transfer using scripting techniques without resorting to the traditional method of
downloading and uploading files. This assignment will test your knowledge of AWS IAM
roles, Lambda functions, and AWS SDK/APIs.

### **Task:**

- Your task is to set up two different AWS accounts, for example, xyz1@example.com and xyz2@example.com.
- Next, you need to add a file of size **at least 1GB and above** to the S3 Bucket of the xyz1@example.com account. Once done you are required to move the file added to the S3 Bucket of the xyz1@example.com account to the S3 Bucket of the xyz2@example.com account using scripting (without downloading and uploading it to the computer)
- The challenge is to use scripting to move files from the S3 bucket of one
AWS account to the S3 bucket of other AWS account.
- Your solution should showcase your ability to utilize AWS services effectively,
adhere to security best practices, and demonstrate proficiency in scripting with the
AWS SDK or API calls.
- **Important:** The following task has to be done for a file size of at least 1GB and above only.
